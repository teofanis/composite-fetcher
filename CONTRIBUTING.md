# Contributing to Composite Fetcher

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Composite Fetcher. It's people like you that make Composite Fetcher such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make one! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

### Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix or implement yourself, then:

1. Fork Composite Fetcher
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b my-feature-name`)
3. Commit your changes (`git add . && pnpm run commit"`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-feature-name`)
5. Open a Pull Request using the branch you've just pushed

### Getting started with the development environment

1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/): `npm install -g pnpm`
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourname/your-library-name.git`
3. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
4. Make sure the tests pass: `pnpm test`

## Writing Code

Ensure your code adheres to the existing style of the project:

- Write tests for your code.
- Run the tests to ensure no existing functionality is broken.
- Document your code, especially if adding new features.
- If adding a new feature, be sure to include examples in the documentation.

## Submitting the Pull Request

Before submitting your pull request, please ensure the following:

1. You have written tests for your changes.
2. All tests are passing.
3. You have updated documentation if necessary.
4. You have completed the pull request template.

Your pull request will be reviewed as soon as possible. Please note that not all pull requests can be immediately merged, but they will receive feedback!
